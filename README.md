## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
*   npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun

### 3. Set up Prismic:

*   The Prismic repository name is configured in `src/prismicio.ts`.

### 4. Environment Variables:

# Add any other environment variables if needed
```
*(Replace `your-prismic-repo-name` with your actual Prismic repository name if it's not already hardcoded or handled by `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PRISMIC_ENVIRONMENT` in `prismicio.ts`)*

### 5. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
